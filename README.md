# INF580_DM1
This is the source code of the 1st homework for the course INF580 (Constraint Programming) at Ecole polytechnique. The subject comes from the April 2014 Google HashCode.

## How to use the code

The project has been done with Eclipse.
`Solution.java` contains the main function and creates an `output.txt` file which contains the solution. In order to output it you have to run the command `python devoirMaison.py paris_54000.txt output.txt`. This creates an `output.gpx` file.
Le projet a été réalisé sous Eclipse.
